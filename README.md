# 🚀 Two Pointers & Greedy Patterns

A curated collection of **two pointers and greedy algorithm problems** focusing on array manipulation, interval handling, and in-place optimization. Each solution is optimized, explained with diagrams, and mapped to real-world scenarios like scheduling, merging intervals, and subarray analysis.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Well-structured Python solutions  
- Optimized O(n) or O(n log n) algorithms  
- Clear explanation of pointer movement and greedy decisions  
- ASCII diagrams showing pointer progression  
- Real-world problem analogies
